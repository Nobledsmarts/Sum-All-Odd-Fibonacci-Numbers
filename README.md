# Sum-All-Odd-Fibonacci-Numbers
Given a positive integer , return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to .numnum

The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first seven numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.

For example, should return because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to are 1, 1, 3, and 5. sumFibs(10) 10 10


# Tests

sumFibs(1) should return a number.

sumFibs(1000) should return 1785.

sumFibs(4000000) should return 4613732.

sumFibs(4) should return 5.

sumFibs(75024) should return 60696.

sumFibs(75025) should return 135721.
